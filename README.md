# CRM-System-Federated-Insurance



The CRM (Customer Relationship Management) System is a comprehensive software application that is designed to manage and maintain all aspects of customer interactions. The main objective of the CRM system is to improve customer relations and maximize customer satisfaction. This project has been developed to design and implement a CRM system for a business organization.

To begin with, a project charter was developed which provided a detailed overview of the project. This document included the project goals, scope, deliverables, and timelines. It also outlined the roles and responsibilities of the project team members, stakeholders, and other relevant individuals.

The next step was to design the database model and Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the CRM system. The database model provided a logical representation of the data that would be stored in the system, while the ERD provided a graphical representation of the relationships between the entities.

After the database model was designed, use cases and use case diagrams were developed to identify the key functionalities of the CRM system. This helped to ensure that all requirements were captured and the system was designed to meet the needs of the end-users.

Once the system requirements were defined, the interface design was developed. The interface was designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with easy navigation and clear labeling of all features.

To manage the project timeline, a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) was created. This provided a hierarchical breakdown of the project tasks, which helped to ensure that the project was completed within the allotted timeframe. A Gantt chart was also developed to provide a visual representation of the project schedule and to monitor progress.

In conclusion, the CRM system designed and developed as part of this project will help the business organization to improve customer relations, maximize customer satisfaction, and streamline business processes. The system includes a well-designed database model, use cases, and use case diagrams to capture all requirements, a user-friendly interface, and a well-managed project timeline.
